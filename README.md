Oro Property Access Component
=============================

The Oro Property Access component reads/writes values from/to object/array graphs using a simple string notation.
Actually this component is mostly a copy of the Symfony PropertyAccess component, but the Oro component allows to use the same syntax of the property path for objects and arrays, and it was the main cause why it was created.
